### Requirements

---

Python dependencies are listed in a `requirements-py.txt` file, including the library version numbers. You can replicate the environment your codebase needs by using virtualenv:

```
# This creates the virtual environment
cd $PROJECT-PATH
virtualenv ensemble-climate-projections
```
Then install the dependencies by referring to the requirements-py.txt:
```
# This installs the modules
pip install -r requirements-py.txt

# This activates the virtual environment
source ensemble-climate-projections/bin/activate
```
